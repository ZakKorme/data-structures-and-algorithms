# Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis

Topics Covered:

- Introduction: What is an algorithm?
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)



What is an **Algorithm**? It is a finite, deterministic, effective set of instructions to complete a specific task as a computer program. It is one of the principle studies of computer science, and our topic of discussion. Generally, algorithmic thinking isn't isolated to computer programs. They can be instructional by nature, mathematical even. But for our purpose they will be computer programs. Most algorithms require the organization of data in specific ways. Therefore, **data structures** are the byproduct of algorithms. 

The algorithms we'll discuss help us solve many problems. Some of these problems are small in nature, requiring a few steps. Which algorithms and data structures we use won't be of importance, regardless of the algorithm, the execution will be quick. But further insight is need in solving larger problems, and the algorithms we select will have an impact on whether we can accomplish the task efficiently, or even complete the task at all.   

This is the first time we've referenced the word efficiency, in some sense that is what we care about with our use of computational devices. Speed - how fast or how long a certain task takes. This will be our next discussion.
